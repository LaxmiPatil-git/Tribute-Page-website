          These were the words of the greatest engineer India has ever seen, the
          engineer whose birthday is celebrated as ‚ÄúEngineers Day‚Äù all over
          India on the 15th of September every year. Visvesvarayya is often used
          as a metaphor here for an extremely intelligent person. We say ‚ÄúHe has
          Visvesvarayya‚Äôs brain"<br />

          He is often quoted as an example by our parents ‚ÄúVisvesvarayya studied
          under the street lamps, why can‚Äôt you with all the facilities‚Äù this is
          what most of the parents use at homes. I am not sure about rest of the
          country but its one popular say in Karnataka üôÇ<br />

          You can guess that his childhood was not easy by the above line. He
          was born in a small village. He studied B.A in Bangalore and later
          pursued civil engineering from Pune.<br />

          On his birthday and India‚Äôs Engineers day we bring out the outstanding
          achievements of the man and a few anecdotes from his life which
          inspire us in plenty ways.

        <h2>5 Inspirational Values to Remember Visvesvarayya</h2>
        <p>
          In this segment, we present a few anecdotes representative of some of
          the values Visvesvarayya stood for and is remembered fondly even
          today.
        </p>

        <h3>1.Honesty and Loyalty</h3>
        <p>
          Some of these instances talk about how closely he held honesty and
          integrity in his value set. Although some of these may sound like
          ideal stories, they still present a valuable asset for our memory to
          shape a character.
        </p>
        <ol type="i">
          <li>
            Once visvesvarayya was working with pen and paper in the dark with a
            lamp. His friend came to meet him. Visvesvarayya quickly blew the
            lamp, brought another set of lamp, pen and paper near his friend.
            Upon asked, on why he did so, Visvesvaraya replied ‚ÄúThat was office
            work and I use it only for that purpose‚Äù
          </li>
          <li>
            Once visvesvarayya received a letter from his friend asking for a
            place to stay for a few days, he intended to stay in the government
            guest house. Visvesvarayya made arrangements for his friend to stay
            at the government guest house by paying a month‚Äôs rent of 250
            rupees.
          </li>
          <li>
            He used the government car only for his official purpose. Even
            though he didn‚Äôt own a car initially he didn‚Äôt make use of the
            government car for his personal works.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          He was a great man with work ethics. What better example for loyalty,
          right? He was sincere to his work and made sure he used office
          facilities only for the office purposes. He never misused his powers,
          unlike many people in power today.
        </p>
        <h3>2. You are never too old to learn something new</h3>
        <p>
          To learn about metallurgy procedures he made a trip to USA with his
          other Indian engineers at an old age. An American officer showed them
          new equipment and procedures.<br />

          They came across a giant machine with 75 foot ladder. The rest of the
          engineers who were very young compared to visvesvarayya hesitated to
          step forward but he was the first person to start climbing.<br />

          Visvesvarayya lived for 101 years and he never considered age as a
          barrier to learn something new in life. He never let his old age and
          physical weakness stop him from trying something new.
        </p>
        <h3>
          3. Punctuality is a value to respect everyone‚Äôs time including yours
        </h3>
        <p>
          Visvesvarayya was never late for his work . He worked from &am to 8pm
          and was considered to be a disciplined man and when it came to his
          work he was extremely punctual and disciplined.<br />

          His time sense didn‚Äôt even spare a minister who was 3 minutes late for
          a meeting. The minister had to take visvesvarayya‚Äôs advice to be on
          time.<br />

          It‚Äôs said that his time sense impressed many people that there were
          instances of people setting time after seeing him. Being on time is
          mostly one tough thing for us to do, isn‚Äôt it? Being on time is
          something which impresses people, not just at the work place but also
          at homes.<br />

          When you are on time you have an opportunity to leave on time üôÇ
        </p>
        <h3>4. Humility is a key trait in giving back to the world</h3>
        <p>
          It was the time when Bhadravati Factory was in trouble was in trouble
          and visvesvarayya was the chairman at that time. It took a few years
          for the government to pay him his salary, which was more than 100,000
          rupees. He denied accepting it saying ‚ÄúStart an institute where boys
          can learn some profession‚Äù<br />

          People wanted to name the institution after visvesvarayya, he denied
          again. He asked it to be named after the king back then, the
          institution is ‚ÄúSri Jayachamaraja Polytechnic Institute‚Äù in
          Bangalore.<br />

          Giving back to the world, isn‚Äôt it? Probably, this is what showing
          value for money means. How humble could this man be? Not accepting
          salary for his hard work and time, insisting to use the money for
          social welfare and upon that he denies to take credit. Would we do
          that? I am not sure about me üòÄ
        </p>
        <h3>5. Preparation is as important as the work itself</h3>
        <p>
          He once visited his Primary school in his hometown. People were
          already aware of his great achievements and success. He was asked to
          speak a few words to the children. He spoke for just five minutes and
          returned home disappointed.<br />

          The reason for his disappointment was the unprepared speech. He wanted
          to make it up . He prepared a speech for the school children, visited
          the school after a few days again and delivered his speech.<br />

          He always made sure he prepared well before his meetings, appointments
          and speeches. Isn‚Äôt it a high attribute of many successful people.?
        </p>
        <h3>6. Equality is not a virtue, but necessity</h3>
        <ol type="i">
          <li>
            It was the time when British officers were given highest esteem in
            Mysore Kingdom and they were provided with comfortable chairs at the
            Mysore Durbars during Dasara whereas the Indian ministers were asked
            to stand or either sit on floor. Visvesvarayya was totally against
            this and because of this bifurcation he stopped going to Durbars.
            After repeated incidents like this, the government decided to allot
            chairs for Indians as well.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once a British officer wrote him a letter to arrange comfortable
            cushions at the Durbars to rest their feet as the height of chairs
            were pretty big. Visvesvarayya replied to the letter saying ‚ÄúThe
            height of the chair has been reduced‚Äù. He never encouraged bossism
            and discrimination or treating Indians ill. He brought in some
            changes in the government offices to treat people equal and nice.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <br />
        <p>
          He was surely a man of great deeds, ethics and values. He dedicated
          his life for the development of modern India and is considered an
          eminent engineer and will always remain the Bharat Ratna.
